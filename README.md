# ElementCounter

- Counts the number of elements in the input set. 
- If an element is another set that contains integers between integer A and B, either count the number of elements in that set, or count the elements of the subset containing only odd integers or even integers in that set. 
- The input set has no restriction on what the elements should be, but only integers are supported when defining ranges inside the input set. 
- When defining range, `_e` or `_o` can be appended to count only even or odd integers respectively.
- Useful for counting the number of questions in your assignment.
